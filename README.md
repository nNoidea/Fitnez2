# Fitnez2

A fitness tracking app for your weight exercises, specially made with Material 3 Expressive + own custom expressive components that go even further than the Material 3 Expressive library.

Note: I cannot guarantee the databases not being reset after an update, in the future, I will implement version tracking to fix this.

## Features
- Track exercises and workouts with ease.
- Predicts your next set based on historical data.
- Built-in localization support (help me add more languages).
- Real-time UI updates for seamless workout logging.

## Build and Run

To build and run the application via command line:

```bash
./gradlew build
./gradlew installDebug
```

Or open the project in Android Studio.
